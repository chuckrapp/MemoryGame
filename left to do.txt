Things left to do:
  
  - Logic
    - button to reset game

  - error handling
    - during timeout after incorrect answer lock other tiles
    - lock correct tiles so they can not be clicked again
  
  - rename some variables to avoid confusion
  
  - check for repeat code
  
  - Make it pretty!
    - Possibly change background color to player turn? (Blue's turn = blue background)
    - Add image to back of cards
