Things left to do:
  

  - button to reset game
  - double check order of functions (combine??)
  
  - rename some variables to avoid confusion
  
  - check for repeat code
  
  - Make it pretty!
    - Possibly change background color or border to player turn? (Blue's turn = blue background)
    - Add image to back of cards
    - Add more status'
